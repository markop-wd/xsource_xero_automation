Minor automation done for Xsource accounting team to alleviate manual input in Xero on a trivial, yet time consuming task.

This was packaged up and sent as an executable application which takes in input via the terminal, uses Selenium for automation, basic logging and records the results in a .csv (so the user can check if anything went wrong while the automation was running)
